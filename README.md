# Anilme_episode_schedular
I have developed a script to schedule the anime episodes to be watched. It cuts two episodes where they are initially stored and paste them in a different folder.

I created this script specifically for "Death Note" anime. I had downloaded all the episodes and stored them in a folder.
Whenever I run the script it moves the next two episodes from the initial folder to a different folder.

This script uses the os module and shutil module for locating and moving the files.
